Hey! 


pace is great. i think you’re teaching as well as anybody could with the material.


My comprehension of js is still a little bit skewed I want to be able to understand it but obviously it will take more time. 

Any suggestions on how I can grasp js better? Maybe I’m overcomplicating it. 

Otherwise its going well. Just wish I understood better, but I’m impatient sometimes as well .

Thanks!

Hi Ron,
Good to hear!  :-)
Honestly, I think that the more practice and familiar you get with Javascript, the
more comfortable you’ll feel.  My suggestion for you to grasp it better would be to 
keep practicing and fooling around with it.  The more you do, the more things
will click and the more you’ll be able to pick up too.
