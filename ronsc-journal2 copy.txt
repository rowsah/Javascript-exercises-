Hey! 


pace is great. i think you’re teaching as well as anybody could with the material.


My comprehension of js is still a little bit skewed I want to be able to understand it but obviously it will take more time. 

Any suggestions on how I can grasp js better? Maybe I’m overcomplicating it. 

Otherwise its going well. Just wish I understood better, but I’m impatient sometimes as well .

Thanks!
